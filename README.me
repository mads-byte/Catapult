## üåç Mission Statement

> We seek to make financial literacy and wealth-building knowledge accessible for all and level uneven playing fields.  
> According to a Massey University study on *The Intergenerational Transfer of Financial Literacy*, financial knowledge often comes from parents and grandparents ‚Äî but what if that knowledge was never passed down?  
>
> **Catapult** aims to change that by teaching financial literacy early, equipping young people with the tools they need to thrive financially before entering the workforce.
