                    <p>Being mindful of how you spend your money can help you save more for what truly matters
                        Some smart spending habits are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spending within your means:</strong> Setting budgets based on your income or
                            allowance helps you understand what you can and can't afford</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid impulse purchases:</strong> Avoid those impulsive online shopping sprees.
                            Instead, leave items in your shopping cart for a day or two before checking out. This gives
                            you time to think through it and reflect if you realy need it </li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce non-essential expenses:</strong> Take some time to reflect on how you spend
                            your money. Make a list of your most common expenses. Then review each non-essential expense
                            to see if you can cut back on anything. For example: Do you really need to go on a coffee
                            run every morning?</li>
                        <li><strong>Distinguish between needs and wants:</strong> Before you buy something ask yourself
                            do you really need this item? or do you just want it for the moment and are going to forget
                            about it later?</li>
                    </ul>

                            affects
                            you every day: Sales Tax. It's when you pay a percentage of the cost of your purchase in
                            addition
                            to the actual cost of the item. You know when those jeans you really want to buy say they
                            cost
                            $36.99 on the tag, but they're a slightly higher price when you get to the register? That's
                            because
                            sales tax has been applied. The sales tax rate varies from state to state. Some states have
                            high sales
                            tax, while other states don't have any sales tax at all.

                            The next one is very important when you get a job: Income Tax. You are responsible for
                            paying
                            the government a portion of all the money you make. The more you earn, the more you owe.
                            When you earn more, you move up to a higher tax bracket. Tax brackets categorize people
                            based
                            on their income in order to determine how much they need to pay. The government agency
                            responsible for enforcing and collecting taxes is called the Internal Revenue Service, more
                            commonly known as the IRS. The IRS investigates and fines those who do not pay. Underpaying
                            or refusing to pay can even result in jail time.

                            If all of this sounds scary, don't worry. Employers are responsible for withholding the
                            taxes from
                            their employees' income and reporting how much was withheld. First, they give a new employee
                            a form called
                            a W-4. It is imperative that the employee fills out this form accurately because this will
                            ensure that the correct
                            amount is withheld and paid to the IRS. Then, the employee will receive a form annually
                            called a W-2
                            which will tell the employee
                            just how much their employer has withheld for taxes.

                            or selling a product, it is best to seek out tax advice from a trained professional.
