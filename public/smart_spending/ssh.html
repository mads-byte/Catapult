    <div class="text">
        <p>Being mindful of how you spend your money can help you save more for what truly matters
           Some smart spending habits are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spending within your means:</strong> Setting budgets based on your income or allowance helps you understand what you can and can't afford</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid impulse purchases:</strong> Avoid those impulsive online shopping sprees. Instead, leave items in your shopping cart for a day or two before checking out. This gives you time to think through it and reflect if you realy need it </li>
            <li><strong>Reduce non-essential expenses:</strong> Take some time to reflect on how you spend your money. Make a list of your most common expenses. Then review each non-essential expense to see if you can cut back on anything. For example: Do you really need to go on a coffee run every morning?</li>
            <li><strong>Distinguish between needs and wants:</strong> Before you buy something ask yourself do you really need this item? or do you just want it for the moment and are going to forget about it later?</li>
        </ul>
